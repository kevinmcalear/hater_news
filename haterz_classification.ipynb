      "# Text Feature Dimensionality Reduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall that the *curse of dimensionality* refers to a collection of problems encountered when using high-dimensional data. A large corpus can easily contain hundreds of thousands of unique tokens. Let's examine some techniques for reducing the dimensions of text features.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "#### Lower-casing\n",
      "\n",
      "A basic strategy for reducing the dimensions of the feature space is to convert all of the text to lowercase. This is motivated by the intuition that the letter case does not contribute to the meanings of most words: \"sandwich\" and \"Sandwich\" have the same meaning in most contexts. Capitalization may indicate that a word is beginning a sentence, but the bag-of-words model has already discarded all information from word order and grammar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "#### Stop Word Filtering\n",
      "\n",
      "A second strategy is to remove words that are common to most of the documents in the corpus. These words, called stop words, frequently include determiners like \"the\" and \"an\", auxiliary verbs like \"do\" and \"has\", and prepositions, like \"on\" and \"beneath\". Stop words are often functional words that contribute to the document's meaning through grammar rather than their denotations. \n",
      "\n",
      "CountVectorizer can filter stop words provided as the `stop_words` keyword parameter, and also includes a basic English stop list. Let's re-create the feature vectors for our documents using lower-casing and stop filtering."

      "\n",
      "While stop filtering is an easy strategy for dimensionality reduction, most stop lists contain only a few hundred words. A large corpus may still have hundreds of thousands of unique words after filtering. Two similar strategies for reducing dimensionality are called stemming and lemmatization.  \n",

      "A high-dimensional document vector may separately encode several derived or inflected forms of the same word. For example, \"jumping\" and \"jumps\" are both forms of the word \"jump\"; a document vector in a corpus of long-jumping articles may encode each inflected form with a separate element in the feature vector.  Stemming and lemmatization are two strategies for condensing inflected and derived forms of a word into a single feature."

      "*Stemming* has a similar goal to lemmatization, but it does not attempt to produce the morphological roots of words. Instead, stemming removes all patterns of characters that appear to be affixes, resulting in a token that is not necessarily a valid word. Lemmatization frequently requires a lexical resource, like WordNet, and the word's part-of-speech. Stemming algorithms frequently use rules instead of lexical resources to produce stems, and can operate on any token, even without its context."

For example, most of the documents in a corpus of articles about Duke's basketball team could include the words \u201cbasketball\u201d, \u201cCoach K\u201d, and \u201cflop\u201d.

Since tf-idf weighted feature vectors are commonly used to represent text, scikit-learn provides a `TfidfVectorizer` class that wraps `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer`. Let's use `TfidfVectorizer` to create tf-idf weighted feature vectors for our corpus."
